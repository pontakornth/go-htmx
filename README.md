# HTMX + Gin demonstration

This repository is an example of using Gin and HTMX to build a simple web application.

## How to run

1. Install Go
2. Use `go run .` in the project directory to run the project
3. Alternatively, install [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) to enable hot reload

Hot-reload means re-compile when you change the source code. You still need to manually reload the web browser.

There is no production configuration as it is intended for demonstration only.
